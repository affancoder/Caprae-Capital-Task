# BizMatch — Connect. Match. Acquire.

A simple, modern, single‑page prototype for a business acquisition marketplace where sellers and buyers discover each other and progress a deal with guided steps.

## Demo
Open `index.html` in your browser.

- No build or server required.
- Works offline (pure HTML/CSS/JS).

## Features
- Welcome landing with role selection (Seller / Buyer)
- Seller onboarding form (business overview and deal preferences)
- Buyer onboarding form (profile and investment criteria)
- Browse buyers grid with rich cards and tags
- Deal flow screen with an AI assistant section and step tracker
- Modal buyer profile with quick “Match” action
- Simulated document upload and AI analysis progress in `deals`

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — Main UI and all screens
- `style.css` — Styling for layout, components, and animations
- `script.js` — Simple interactions, screen routing, modal logic, and AI analysis simulation

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (responsive layout, cards, modals)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Navigate using the top navigation: Home, Browse, Deals.
3. Choose a role on the Welcome screen to see onboarding flows.
4. In Browse, click a buyer to view profile; send a match.
5. In Deals, try the AI Financial Analyzer to see a simulated analysis.

## Notes & Limitations
- Prototype: data is static and stored in the DOM.
- AI features are simulated for demonstration.
- Navigation uses simple screen toggling, not routing.

## Roadmap Ideas
- Real data models and persistence (e.g., localStorage or API backend)
- Authentication and user profiles
- Search, filter, and sort enhancements
- File upload with real parsing and summary generation
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation improvements
